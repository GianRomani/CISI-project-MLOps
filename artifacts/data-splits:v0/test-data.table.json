The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.

Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.

The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.

Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory, it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained.

Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list.

The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.

For example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man.. To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc.. Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is more  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it falls into category I or II.. The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly, etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper.."], ["54", "What is the effect on librarians of automation?

Using his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to the user..

The degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.

Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information.

An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision..

Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance to scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right.

Consequently, a new set of mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of scientific development.

Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.

Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He is careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, in case the value of the aging factor a or the contents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet very little experimental evidence on the consistency of either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor is reasonably constant.  But the position of the Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M. Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in the Journal of Ecology three or more times in 1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in both.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant. There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no mention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in terms of library use.

Their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.

The scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.  The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.

The scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.  The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure is similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.", "101", "Social Factors in the Origins of a New Science: The Case of Psychology", "The uninterrupted growth of a scientific field depends upon the existence of a scientific community permanently devoting itself to the field..

Using Germany as a positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of the human mind into an experimental science.."], ["44", "There are presently fifty to one hundred technical journals being published.

The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists..

One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library..

User profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially assigned significance value.. These values are used in making the decision to notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document.. According to responses, the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user's interests.. The system is economical compared to other existing SDI systems and human intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries.."], ["50", "Is there any use for traditional classification schemes - DDC, UDC, LC, etc. - in information retrieval systems?

The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.

The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.

The cost analysis reveals a positive net present value and a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of capital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economically justifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial and periodical titles)..

The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting \"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty.  The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular  notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI service continued.."], ["109", "It is shown that the mapping of a particular area of science, in this case information science, can be done using authors as units of analysis and the cocitations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates their \"distances\" from each other.

The raw data are cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social Sciences Citation Index) over the period 1972-1979.

Equally, in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of characterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument; but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this, or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has raged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios."], ["21", "The need to provide personnel for the information field.", "1147", "A Core Medical Library for Practitioners in Community Hospitals", "In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate and encourage continuing education programs in community hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute (PMI) has determined that there is need for guidance in the area of medical-library development. Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited more than 40 community hospitals indicate that medical-library facilities are generally poor and infrequently used by physicians.  The basic weaknesses of these libraries fall into four categories: inadequate collections, inadequate personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of any practical indexing system to facilitate use of collections that do exist. Failure to deal with these problems does not reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation to do so and absence of any concerted source of guidance.  In response to requests for such guidance PMI has undertaken a community hospital library development project in co-operation with the New England Regional Medical Library Service (NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.  This report is concerned with the first phase of this project - namely, the formulation of a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and journals that can function as the core for a medical library. Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical practice, including the basic sciences.  The specialists, chosen from regions throughout the country, were requested to recommend two textbooks and two journals in their area of special interest that they considered to be the most basic and fundamentally useful for practitioners.
