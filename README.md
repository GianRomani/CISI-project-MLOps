# CISI-project-MLOps
Information Retrieval project on the CISI dataset for the Weight & Biases course.

The data were collected by the Centre for Inventions and Scientific Information ("CISI") and consist of text data about 1,460 documents and 112 associated queries. Its purpose is to be used to build models of information retrieval where a given query will return a list of document IDs relevant to the query. 

The file "CISI.REL" contains the correct list of query-document matching.
The file "CISI.ALL" contains the documents, with the ID, title, author, and list of cross-references to other documents.
The file "CISI.QRY" contains a list of queries and their IDs.

This dataset has been made publicly available by the Information Retrieval Group at the University of Glasgow (https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/).
